# üîç Gemini Fullstack LangGraph ‚Äì Enhanced Fork

> A research-augmented AI assistant using Google Gemini, LangGraph, and FastAPI ‚Äì now with added features, improved UX, and multimodal support üöÄ

## üß† What is This?

This is a **fork and upgrade** of [google-gemini/gemini-fullstack-langgraph-quickstart](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-fullstack-langgraph-quickstart), originally built to demonstrate how LangGraph agents can do iterative search and synthesis using Gemini models.

My goal is to **extend it into a production-level AI research assistant** with added features, richer prompts, and new use cases like file-based search and developer-oriented tools.

1. **User selects a prompt template or enters custom query**
2. **Optional: Upload documents for context-aware analysis**
3. **Gemini processes documents and generates search keywords**
4. **Google Search tool fetches relevant links**
5. **Gemini reflects on results, incorporating document insights**
6. **Agent loops back if needed for additional research**
7. **Final synthesis combines web research with document analysis**

## üß™ Try It Locally

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
pip install -e .

# Frontend  
cd ../frontend
npm install --force  # Force install to resolve version conflicts
npm run dev  # Runs on http://localhost:5173

# Backend (separate terminal)
cd backend
langgraph dev  # Runs on http://localhost:2024
```

## üìã Original Features

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main directories:

-   `frontend/`: Contains the React application built with Vite.
-   `backend/`: Contains the LangGraph/FastAPI application, including the research agent logic.

## Getting Started: Development and Local Testing

Follow these steps to get the application running locally for development and testing.

**1. Prerequisites:**

-   Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm)
-   Python 3.11+
-   **`GEMINI_API_KEY`**: The backend agent requires a Google Gemini API key.
    1.  Navigate to the `backend/` directory.
    2.  Create a file named `.env` by copying the `backend/.env.example` file.
    3.  Open the `.env` file and add your Gemini API key: `GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY"`

**2. Install Dependencies:**

**Backend:**

```bash
cd backend
pip install .
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install --force  # Use --force to resolve dependency conflicts
```

**3. Run Development Servers:**

**Backend & Frontend:**

```bash
make dev
```
This will run the backend and frontend development servers.    Open your browser and navigate to the frontend development server URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173/app`).

_Alternatively, you can run the backend and frontend development servers separately. For the backend, open a terminal in the `backend/` directory and run `langgraph dev`. The backend API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:2024`. It will also open a browser window to the LangGraph UI. For the frontend, open a terminal in the `frontend/` directory and run `npm run dev`. The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`._

## How the Backend Agent Works (High-Level)

The core of the backend is a LangGraph agent defined in `backend/src/agent/graph.py`. It follows these steps:

<img src="./agent.png" title="Agent Flow" alt="Agent Flow" width="50%">

1.  **Generate Initial Queries:** Based on your input, it generates a set of initial search queries using a Gemini model.
2.  **Document Processing (New):** If files are uploaded, processes them to extract insights and context.
3.  **Web Research:** For each query, it uses the Gemini model with the Google Search API to find relevant web pages.
4.  **Reflection & Knowledge Gap Analysis:** The agent analyzes the search results to determine if the information is sufficient or if there are knowledge gaps. It uses a Gemini model for this reflection process.
5.  **Iterative Refinement:** If gaps are found or the information is insufficient, it generates follow-up queries and repeats the web research and reflection steps (up to a configured maximum number of loops).
6.  **Finalize Answer:** Once the research is deemed sufficient, the agent synthesizes the gathered information into a coherent answer, including citations from the web sources, using a Gemini model.

## CLI Example

For quick one-off questions you can execute the agent from the command line. The
script `backend/examples/cli_research.py` runs the LangGraph agent and prints the
final answer:

```bash
cd backend
python examples/cli_research.py "What are the latest trends in renewable energy?"
```

- **CSV Data** - Statistical analysis and insights
- **Images** - Metadata extraction (OCR coming soon)
- **Text Files** - Direct content analysis

## Deployment

In production, the backend server serves the optimized static frontend build. LangGraph requires a Redis instance and a Postgres database. Redis is used as a pub-sub broker to enable streaming real time output from background runs. Postgres is used to store assistants, threads, runs, persist thread state and long term memory, and to manage the state of the background task queue with 'exactly once' semantics. For more details on how to deploy the backend server, take a look at the [LangGraph Documentation](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/deployment_options/). Below is an example of how to build a Docker image that includes the optimized frontend build and the backend server and run it via `docker-compose`.

_Note: For the docker-compose.yml example you need a LangSmith API key, you can get one from [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/settings)._

_Note: If you are not running the docker-compose.yml example or exposing the backend server to the public internet, you should update the `apiUrl` in the `frontend/src/App.tsx` file to your host. Currently the `apiUrl` is set to `http://localhost:8123` for docker-compose or `http://localhost:2024` for development._

**1. Build the Docker Image:**

   Run the following command from the **project root directory**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t gemini-fullstack-langgraph -f Dockerfile .
   ```
**2. Run the Production Server:**

   ```bash
   GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_gemini_api_key> LANGSMITH_API_KEY=<your_langsmith_api_key> docker-compose up
   ```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8123/app/` to see the application. The API will be available at `http://localhost:8123`.
